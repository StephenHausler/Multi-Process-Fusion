# Multi-Process-Fusion
Multi-Process Fusion: Visual Place Recognition Using Multiple Image Processing Methods

Note: Currently at Revision 0.1 and full functionality is not guaranteed.
Revision 0.2 due on 14/09/2018.

Requirements:
1) MATLAB 2017 or later.
2) MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox.
3) Computer with stand-alone graphics hardware.
4) A downloaded CNN caffemodel and prototxt (not included in this repository).

Getting Started:
1) Obtain CNN model files. For HybridNet, permission must be attained from the original author.
    Other networks will also work.
2) To begin, launch MATLAB and open Multi_Process_Fusion.m.
3) Edit the adjustable settings for your particular dataset.
4) Run the file. Note: the reference traverse will take several minutes with no intermediate feedback.
    Once the query traverse begins, a figure will display the recognition process.
